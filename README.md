# Detection Method for Distributed Web-Crawlers: a Long-tail Threshold Model

This paper proposes an advanced countermeasure against distributed web-crawlers. We investigated other methods for crawler detection and analyzed how distributed crawlers can bypass these methods.  Our method can detect distributed crawlers by focusing on the property that web traffics follow the power distribution.
